## How to run the project

You'll need java installed, if you don't already have it, get [Java JDK 11 here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)

Clone the project and in the project directory run `Java -jar Lafayette-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

This should start up Camunda and once it's running you should be able to access it by going to http://localhost:8080/ and logging in with:
